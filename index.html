            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My name is <em>Noah Harvey</em>, I was raised and born in Louisville, Kentucky and I am currently 23 years old. My hobbies consist of studying football schemes, watching anime and, thanks to  Code:You, my new and favorite hobby is learning to code. I first was introduced to coding in 2020 during the Pandemic and was drawn to coding because it was the first time i couldn't understand the material i was learing just by simply looking at it. This time I've had to truly challange and apply myself to spend time learing and practicing different programming languages, and while it's been a challange it has also been very fun and fulfilling to see my hard work start to pay off. But I know i still have a long way to go in this journey that's why I always remind myself to be willing to ask questions and learn along each step of this journey, and hopefully you'll be apart of it to witness. </p>
